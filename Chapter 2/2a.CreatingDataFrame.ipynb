    "# Introducing The Table for Scientific Python: The DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "A series is a flexible tool for managing a single distribution with an index. The index can be either the default sequence of numbers starting from zero, or it can be a list of labels. If we have two Series, each with the same index, we can combine them together. This will create a DataFrame. Depending on the nature of the research we will either be building a DataFrame by merging together series one by one or we will import a DataFrame from another context, be it a text file, a webpage or some other file format. In this section, we will be building small DataFrames from scratch in order to demonstrate their features and highlight the similarities and differences to these operations when done on a Series. In the next chapter we will show how to create a DataFrame from existing file formats."

    "# Getting Data in to a DataFrames \n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point we have only seen DataFrames that look like nicely formatted Series. However, it is important for us to be able to compare multiple columns of data. To get these multiple columns of data, here are a few approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From a list of lists (or equivalently, an Array),\n",
    "2. From a dictionary where the keys are indices and the values are lists of data,\n",
    "3. By adding a new series to an existing DataFrame . \n",
    "\n",
    "These different ways of building DataFrames will form the basis of a great deal of your work in data science. As you will see later, data comes in a variety of formats, but we need to transform the data into a consistent and workable format for analysis. Thus, getting this data into a DataFrame will be of central importance. Although there are many possible ways to create a DataFrame, they essentially are variants on these three: from a list of lists, from an existing DataFrame/Series, from a Dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the uninitiated, you might wonder what is the advantage of doing this over just typing in data in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program? Returning to the discussion in Chapter 1 about fixed versus marginal costs, it will become evident through working with data that while spreadsheets have a very low fixed cost (since you just load them up and start typing in data), they have a very high marginal cost, since every operation and new data point can involve lots of clicking, saving, and typing. We want to avoid marginal costs (where each new row or line of data takes up our time) so that we can more effectively scale from three or four rows up to three or four thousand (or million) rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create these multi-column DataFrames we will continue to use information about some of the Muppets we have already mentioned. This time, in addition to the 'type of muppet', we will add a column about their first apperance as well as well as their gender. "

Also, Pandas can be pretty clever about linking the data. Notice above that we had a dictionary with Gonzo first, but the DataFrame had Kermit first? Since ```Gonzo``` was the index for both the existing DataFrame and the new Series, when they were merged the program was able to link the data together. In this case, we can think of Gonzo's name as the _key_ that links the data. Series and dictionaries have keys, but lists do not.

    "\n",
    "You can return multiple rows at once. This is handy when you want to filter and merge data. As a motivating example, imagine that you download data from _reddit_ and insert it into a table. It will have a ton of extraneous columns. The data you want to study might be a small subset of what is available. Asking for the columns you want and building your dataset from there is a prudent way to keep focused on a research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ask for multiple columns, you must ask for them as a collection _inside_ the indexer. This means it typically looks like square brackets inside square brackets. For example, asking for ```MuppetYear``` and ```MuppetType``` in the same query would be as ```muppetdf[ [\"MuppetYear\",\"MuppetType\"]]```. Whatever order you ask for them is the order they will be in the resulting DataFrame. "

    "### Returning a single element \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a single element of a DataFrame is an extension of what we just did. Now that we have a Series (the row), we can then query for one element of that row. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we queried for ```.loc[\"Gonzo\"]```, it returned a Series corresponding to Gonzo's row in the DataFrame. Since this Series has labels (corresponding to Gonzo's values in the table)  we can then use the labels to get one element from Gonzo's row. We can also use position in the Series, which I will show afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the year of Gonzo's first appearance, we can chain together ```muppetdf.loc[\"Gonzo\"]``` with ```[\"MuppetYear\"]```. This will then look like ```muppetdf.loc[\"Gonzo\"][\"MuppetYear\"]```. Lukcily, Pandas provides a little \"syntactic sugar\", so that you can put row then column in the same indexer like so: ```muppetdf.loc[\"Gonzo\",\"MuppetYear\"]```. Since Gonzo was in position 2 and MuppetYear is in position 1, we could also write ```muppetdf.iloc[2,1]```. Note the latter one is _iloc_ since we are using position.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering now about whether you can use ```muppetdf[\"MuppetYear\"]``` first to get the entire column and then find Gonzo in that column. You sure can, however, it is worth pointing out that this is considered bad form. Generally speaking, go rows first. It is for this reason that while you can indeed query ```muppetdf[\"MuppetYear\"][\"Gonzo\"]```, you can neither use the syntactic sugar of ```muppetdf[\"MuppetYear\",\"Gozno\"]``` nor ```muppetdf[1,2]```. It is here that we are reminded that a DataFrame is not considered a completely symmetric data structure. Rather, rows are for cases and columns are for varaibles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three ways to query: ```[\"row_label\"][\"column_label\"]```, ```[\"row_label\",\"column_label\"]``` or ```[\"row_position\",\"column_position\"]```, which one would be considered the most Pythonic? Recall **FREE**. They are all functional. However, one approach is typically more robust: using labels. The labels for rows and columns should not change even if the data varies. Consequently, using labels (```.loc```) is often more robust than position (```.iloc```) since position can change with sort order. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, of ```[\"row\"][\"column\"]``` or ```[\"row\",\"column\"]``` which one would be more efficient? The second one is more efficient, because Pandas treats it as a single query. In the first instance (i.e. ```[\"row\"][\"column\"]```, you get the row as a new series, then you look inside it. In the second case, you get the row and the column in a single indexer request, no intermediary series necessary. This will not be noticable in these toy DataFrames, but when you are handling large amounts of data, these speed gains can really affect the time it takes to complete tasks. It has a second benefit that we will cover at the end of the chapter in the section on deep versus shallow copying. First lets get through all the ways to get data out, we have one left."

This becomes a series of ```True```, ```False``` statements. If the row corresponds to a ```True``` statement, it is kept. Observe: "
